# Gilded Rose

* Description of the kata: http://iamnotmyself.com/2011/02/14/refactor-this-the-gilded-rose-kata/
* Legacy code (Javascript-Jasmine) from here: https://github.com/emilybache/GildedRose-Refactoring-Kata

## Questions while working on this kata
* Is it valid to create separate classes for standard items and each of the special items (aged brie, backstage passes)?
* Should I have refactored the methods to be even shorter?
